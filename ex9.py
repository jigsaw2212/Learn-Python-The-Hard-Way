days= "Mon Tue Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun"

print "Here are the days:",days
print "Here are the months:",months
#Outputs the 12 months in 12 separate lines

print 'Here are the months %r' %months
#Outputs all the 12 months in one single line, because of this property of %r to output the raw text void of any formatting. So it displays the \n literally, without converting it into a line break 

print 'Here are the months %s' %months
#Will again print all the months separately


print '''I can write anything between three double/single quotes
blah blah blah.. You can't stop me at this! 
I'm invincible
Now i'm gonna try and add two such triple quote format thingys inside this one'''
