#Means, print values from 3 to 10 and keep incrementing by 4

#Now i'll use lambda
#Python supports functional programming, in which we pass functions to other functions, lambda makes our job easier by helping us to easily define short anonymous functions which is not directly accessed

sum= lambda x,y: x+y
print sum(2,3)
#prints the value 5

#the following code gives us all the permutations of list a

print permutations(a)

exec 'print "Hello"'


with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
     f.write('Hi there!')

print a
del a #Deletes the variable a from the namespace
#Doing 'print a' now will give an error as python doesn't recognise the variable 'a' anymore
