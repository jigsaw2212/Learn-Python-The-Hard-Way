#Helping python around double and single quotes

print "I am 6'2\" tall\f"
#The above code escapes the double quote inside the string
#\v prints a vertical tab, which is just skipping one line. An idle print statement would do the same

print 'I am 6\'2" tall'
#The above code escapes the single quote inside the string
